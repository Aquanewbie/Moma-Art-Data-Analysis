 <br/>

## Methods: ##

## Conclusions: ##

-The model predicted every image in the training set accurately. <br/>
-We received a mean accuracy score of 1.00, a perfect score.v<br/>
-We believe the data source lacks variability, give the model no room for error when test on images not too different from the images <br/>
-When utilizing the model to predict the fruit classification of images outside the dataset, the model was found to be highly erroneous.<br/>
